        We feel that this analysis is very important for Boston residents,
        policy makers, and Boston government as it provides an alternative
        approach at identifying inequitable government services. By analyzing
        311 requests for rodent occurrences, we are able to assess the success
        and consistency of Boston government‚Äôs techniques for rodent prevention
        and mediation at the neighborhood, income, and racial level. Across some
        axes (Case completion time vs. income level, non-completed cases vs.
        income level, rodent cases per capita vs. neighborhood), Boston
        performed well in terms of fair treatment. However, we have preliminary
        results that present some disparity in rodent presence: higher white
        populated neighborhoods often have lower rodent presence and low income
        neighborhoods have a higher rate of non-completed rodent 311 cases.

        However, some limitations do exist. The 311 dataset only includes
        reported rodent sightings, which does not account for unreported cases
        or systemic differences in complaint frequency across neighborhoods.
        Some residents may be less likely to report rodent issues due to
        language barriers, lack of awareness, or distrust in city services,
        potentially skewing the data. It is worth letting this analysis motivate
        inspection into animal control services, sanitation practices, and 311
        reporting accessibility to ensure that rodents are not unequally
        bothersome for any Boston community.

        For technical tools we implemented HTML, CSS, JavaScript with the D3.js
        library, Python visualization packages (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair).
