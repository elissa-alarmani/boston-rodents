        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> These charts show the racial demographic
        distribution for each Boston neighborhood. Each racial group and its
        corresponding percentage of population for each neighborhood is
        displayed, and this gives us the ability to do some preliminary analysis
        about racial concentrations in Boston, and provides context for Boston‚Äôs
        racial makeup. White people make up the largest portion of most Boston
        neighborhoods, with highest proportions in neighborhoods like
        Charlestown, South Boston, and Beacon Hill. Black people make up the
        largest proportion in neighborhoods like Mattapan and Roxbury. Hispanic
        people make up the largest proportion in East Boston and Roxbury.
        Finally Asian people make up the largest proportion in Downtown and
        Allston. These charts reveal Boston‚Äôs varied racial demographics
        throughout the city and reaffirm the value of evaluating our rodent
        occurrence metrics separately for different neighborhoods; each
        neighborhood is vastly different in terms of ethnicity and have diverse
        populations.

        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph explores the racial makeup of each
        neighborhood in Boston. It shows that the neighborhoods with the highest
        percentage of White population are Beacon Hill, South Boston, and
        Charlestown. Additionally, Downtown has the highest Asian population,
        East Boston has the highest Hispanic population, and Mattapan has the
        highest Black population. It is clear that each neighborhood is
        different, with no clear pattern of one racial group being the majority
        in every neighborhood. The key takeaway of this is that there is a lot
        of variation among Boston neighborhoods, but not necessarily within
        them.

          <p>
            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph shows the per capita
            occurrences of rodent cases for each neighborhood in Boston. This
            graph accounts for population variance in each neighborhood by
            determining the number of rat occurrences per person. The data seems
            to be centered around approximately .007 rodent cases per capita,
            with 11/20 neighborhoods falling between .004 and .01 rodents per
            capita. The graph reveals that Back bay, Downton, and South End have
            the highest per capita rodent cases, all above 0.012. Notably,
            Allston, Brighton, Fenway/Kenmore, and South Boston all have per
            capita values below .003. The takeaway from this graph is that many
            neighborhoods have a similar rodent occurrences per capita value,
            but there are some notably low and high rodent values that may
            indicate potential public health and sanitation disparities among
            Boston neighborhoods.

            height="550"
          ></iframe>
          <p>
            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph shows the per capita
            occurrences of rodent cases for the highest income neighborhoods in
            Boston and the lowest income neighborhoods in Boston. The income
            groups are determined by the 3 highest and 3 lowest median income
            neighborhoods in Boston. The high income group had a rodent
            occurrence per capita value of .0096, more than .003 higher than the
            low income groups value of .0063. One potential takeaway from this
            graph is that high income neighborhoods tend to be situated in rat
            prone geographical locations. It may also reveal a social pattern of
            higher income individuals, and a higher likelihood to report rodent
            occurrences using Boston‚Äôs 311 system.

      <p>
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This series of graphs explores rat sightings
        in different neighborhoods based on their racial makeup. The graphs
        exploring the neighborhoods with the highest and lowest Black, Asian,
        and Hispanic populations all follow the same pattern: the neighborhoods
        with more of those populations have more rat sightings, and the
        neighborhoods with less of those populations have less rat sightings.
        The graph that explores the rat sightings in the highest and lowest
        White neighborhoods show the opposite: the top three percent White
        neighborhoods have lower rat sightings than the bottom three percent
        White neighborhoods. This concludes that the higher the percentage of
        White people in the neighborhood, the lower the count of rat sightings.

        <p>
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph compares the distribution of
          case time completion for high and low income neighborhoods. The income
          groups are determined by the 3 highest and 3 lowest median income
          neighborhoods in Boston. We can see that the minimum, center, and IQR
          placement for both groups are very similar with medians around ~23
          hours. The main difference between these graphs are the outliers in
          the low income group. There are 3 rodent occurrence instances that all
          have completion times above 1000 hours in Roxbury. This potentially
          indicates a systemic disparity between public health and sanitation
          practices for low income neighborhoods. This graph suggests, however,
          that there is no real difference between case completion distribution
          for low and high income neighborhoods.

          <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph shows the percentage of rodent

          neighborhoods. The income groups are determined by the 3 highest and 3
          lowest median income neighborhoods in Boston. We can see that there is
          a higher rate of non-completion for low income neighborhoods, with a
          rate of .92% and .72% non-completion for the low and high income
          neighborhoods respectively. Still these rates are below 1% and very
          low, thus implying that non-completion is not a large issue for either
          income bracket.

        <p>
          <strong>Takeaway: </strong> This graph shows the percentage of rodent
          occurrence cases that were not completed for each neighborhood. All

          3.3%. The neighborhood with the highest not completed rate is South
          Boston. The neighborhoods with the lowest rates are Dorchester and
          Back Bay. This indicates that some neighborhoods may have disparate
          access to 311/sanitation/animal control government personnel, but it
          doesn‚Äôt appear that any neighborhoods are severely unequally treated
          by this metric.

      <p>
        <strong>Takeaway: </strong>This map shows the average resolution times
        in hours for the cases per neighborhood. The darker color represents a
        longer resolution time and the lighter colors represent shorter
        resolution times. The darkest red shows resolution times that took over
        46 hours, or nearly two days. The neighborhoods that had this average
        time were Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, Mattapan, and Downtown. The lightest
        yellow indicates neighborhoods with average resolution times between
        30-35 hours. These neighborhoods were Dorchester, South Boston, East
        Boston, and Allston. This could indicate a few things. Either these
        neighborhoods closer to the downtown area see more rat incidences, or
        resources are diverted to the lighter yellow areas.

        <strong>Takeaway: </strong>This map shows the majority race that resides
        in each neighborhood. The legend only includes Black, Hispanic, and
        White labels because these are the only majorities that exist, but this
        does not mean that people of other races do not live in these
        neighborhoods. From the map, we gather that Black people are
        concentrated in Roxbury, Mattapan, Dorchester, and Hyde Park. East
        Boston has as majority Hispanic population. All of the other
        neighborhoods have a majority White population. This shows some overlap
        with the previous map: neighborhoods with more people of color
        experience slower resolution times. Some neighborhoods that have a
        designated majority white population may still experience slower
        resolution times because those places could also have more rats to begin
        with.

        represents an individual report allowing for immediate identification of
        spatial clusters and neighborhood-specific patterns. Denser
        concentrations of reports in certain areas suggest localized rodent
        issues that may correlate with population density, income, or
        infrastructure conditions. Notably there appears to be a more condensed
        cluster in neighborhoods like the South End, the North End, and South
        Boston. In other neighborhoods like Mission Hill, Fenway, and
        Dorchester, the rodent cases look more evenly spread out but prevelant.
