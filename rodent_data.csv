Closed date : 2024-05-09 03:23:35.93 Case Noted Dear environmental inspector:    I am the homeowner of 3 Ayr Road in Brighton. I have called and filed a complaint about progressively worsening rat activities at 32 Orkney Road  Brighton and 5 Ayr Road  Brighton. I would like to provide more information here to facilitate your inspection.    32 Orkney Road has had multiple burrows throughout their front yard over the last couple years  which has become a health and safety hazard. I have reached out to its CRM Property Management to address the issue but no success. 5 Ayr Road Brighton also ignored the trash and rat problems for a long time.    I have put into significant effort to clean the trash  trash cans  sidewalks and paid for regular pest control service. My pest control person is Bill Godfrey (cell 508-505-5564). He has set up EVO stations and hardwire cloth installation of back porch. However  nothing is very effective unless our neighbors also take their actions. Thank you in advance for helping the neighborhood to control the rat activity.

Closed date : 2024-05-09 03:23:16.317 Case Noted Dear environmental inspector:    I am the homeowner of 3 Ayr Road in Brighton. I have called and filed a complaint about progressively worsening rat activities at 32 Orkney Road  Brighton and 5 Ayr Road  Brighton. I would like to provide more information here to facilitate your inspection.    32 Orkney Road has had multiple burrows throughout their front yard over the last couple years  which has become a health and safety hazard. I have reached out to its CRM Property Management to address the issue but no success. 5 Ayr Road Brighton also ignored the trash and rat problems for a long time.    I have put into significant effort to clean the trash  trash cans  sidewalks and paid for regular pest control service. My pest control person is Bill Godfrey (cell 508-505-5564). He has set up EVO stations and hardwire cloth installation of back porch. However  nothing is very effective unless our neighbors also take their actions. Thank you in advance for helping the neighborhood to control the rat activity.
