        Takeaway: The racial pie charts across Boston neighborhoods show a clear
        pattern of demographic concentration, where many neighborhoods are
        predominantly made up of a single racial or ethnic group. While some
        areas such as Downtown and Mission Hill reflect greater racial
        diversity, others like Beacon Hill, South Boston, and Mattapan are more
        homogeneous, with one racial group making up a dominant share of the
        population.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neighborhoods like Beacon Hill and South Boston are predominantly White,
        often with over 75% of the population identifying as White Alone. In
        contrast, neighborhoods such as Mattapan and Roxbury exhibit
        significantly higher proportions of Black/African-American and Hispanic
        residents, often with those two groups together forming the majority.
        Interestingly, Asian populations tend to cluster more significantly in
        neighborhoods like Downtown and Fenway, where their proportions are much
        higher relative to other areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This racial segmentation suggests that Boston‚Äôs neighborhoods are not
        equally racially integrated, and instead reflect long-standing patterns
        of residential segregation and socioeconomic disparities. These
        demographic trends are essential context for understanding differences
        in rat-related complaints and city response times, as discussed
        throughout this project.

            name and the race group‚Äôs percentage.

            <strong>racial composition</strong> of every Boston neighborhood.

            Compare racial diversity across communities and look for standout
            trends or imbalances.

      <p>
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph explores the racial makeup of each
        neighborhood in Boston. It shows that the neighborhoods with the highest
        percentage of White population are Beacon Hill, South Boston, and
        Charlestown. Additionally, Downtown has the highest Asian population,
        East Boston has the highest Hispanic population, and Mattapan has the
        highest Black population. It is clear that each neighborhood is
        different, with no clear pattern of one racial group being the majority
        in every neighborhood. The key takeaway of this is that there is a lot
        of variation among Boston neighborhoods, but not necessarily within
        them.

      <p>
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This series of graphs explores rat sightings
        in different neighborhoods based on their racial makeup. The graphs
        exploring the neighborhoods with the highest and lowest Black, Asian,
        and Hispanic populations all follow the same pattern: the neighborhoods
        with more of those populations have more rat sightings, and the
        neighborhoods with less of those populations have less rat sightings.
        The graph that explores the rat sightings in the highest and lowest
        White neighborhoods show the opposite: the top three percent White
        neighborhoods have lower rat sightings than the bottom three percent
        White neighborhoods. This concludes that the higher the percentage of
        White people in the neighborhood, the lower the count of rat sightings.

        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This map visualizes the geographic
        distribution of rodent-related 311 cases across Boston. Each dot
        represents an individual report, color-coded by neighborhood, allowing
        for immediate identification of spatial clusters and
        neighborhood-specific patterns. Denser concentrations of reports in
        certain areas suggest localized rodent issues that may correlate with
        population density, income, or infrastructure conditions.
