      <h3>Race Bar Chart by Neighborhood</h3>

        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph explores the racial makeup of each
        neighborhood in Boston. It shows that the neighborhoods with the highest
        percentage of White population are Beacon Hill, South Boston, and
        Charlestown. Additionally, Downtown has the highest Asian population,
        East Boston has the highest Hispanic population, and Mattapan has the
        highest Black population. It is clear that each neighborhood is
        different, with no clear pattern of one racial group being the majority
        in every neighborhood. The key takeaway of this is that there is a lot
        of variation among Boston neighborhoods, but not necessarily within
        them.

        />
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This series of graphs explores rat sightings
        in different neighborhoods based on their racial makeup. The graphs
        exploring the neighborhoods with the highest and lowest Black, Asian,
        and Hispanic populations all follow the same pattern: the neighborhoods
        with more of those populations have more rat sightings, and the
        neighborhoods with less of those populations have less rat sightings.
        The graph that explores the rat sightings in the highest and lowest
        White neighborhoods show the opposite: the top three percent White
        neighborhoods have lower rat sightings than the bottom three percent
        White neighborhoods. This concludes that the higher the percentage of
        White people in the neighborhood, the lower the count of rat sightings.

      <h2 class="section-title">Interactive Rodent Incident Map</h2>
      <p>
        The interactive scatter map allows users to explore the exact locations
        of rodent-related 311 complaints throughout Boston. Each data point
        represents a reported rodent incident and is color-coded by neighborhood
        for easy visual differentiation. Users can zoom and pan around the city,
        and clicking on any point reveals detailed case-level information,
        including the case ID, street name, ward, and neighborhood. This
        interactivity makes it intuitive to identify clusters of rodent activity
        and explore neighborhood-specific patterns in depth, supporting an
        accessible and engaging user experience for both casual viewers and data
        analysts.

        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This map visualizes the geographic
        distribution of rodent-related 311 cases across Boston. Each dot
        represents an individual report, color-coded by neighborhood, allowing
        for immediate identification of spatial clusters and
        neighborhood-specific patterns. Denser concentrations of reports in
        certain areas suggest localized rodent issues that may correlate with
        population density, income, or infrastructure conditions.
