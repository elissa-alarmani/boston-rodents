        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> The racial pie charts across Boston
        neighborhoods show a clear pattern of demographic concentration, where
        many neighborhoods are predominantly made up of a single racial or
        ethnic group. While some areas such as Downtown and Mission Hill reflect
        greater racial diversity, others like Beacon Hill, South Boston, and
        Mattapan are more homogeneous, with one racial group making up a
        dominant share of the population. Neighborhoods like Beacon Hill and
        South Boston are predominantly White, often with over 75% of the
        population identifying as White Alone. In contrast, neighborhoods such
        as Mattapan and Roxbury exhibit significantly higher proportions of
        Black/African-American and Hispanic residents, often with those two
        groups together forming the majority. Interestingly, Asian populations
        tend to cluster more significantly in neighborhoods like Downtown and
        Fenway, where their proportions are much higher relative to other areas.
        This racial segmentation suggests that Boston‚Äôs neighborhoods are not
        equally racially integrated, and instead reflect long-standing patterns
        of residential segregation and socioeconomic disparities. These
        demographic trends are essential context for understanding differences
        in rat-related complaints and city response times, as discussed
        throughout this project.

      <p>
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph explores the racial makeup of each
        neighborhood in Boston. It shows that the neighborhoods with the highest
        percentage of White population are Beacon Hill, South Boston, and
        Charlestown. Additionally, Downtown has the highest Asian population,
        East Boston has the highest Hispanic population, and Mattapan has the
        highest Black population. It is clear that each neighborhood is
        different, with no clear pattern of one racial group being the majority
        in every neighborhood. The key takeaway of this is that there is a lot
        of variation among Boston neighborhoods, but not necessarily within
        them.

      <h2 class="section-title">2. Rat Reports by Neighborhood</h2>

      <div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap">
        <div style="flex: 1 1 48%">
          <iframe

          <p>
            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph shows the per capita
            occurrences of rodent cases for each neighborhood in Boston. This
            graph accounts for population variance in each neighborhood by
            determining the number of rat occurrences per person. The data seems
            to be centered around approximately .007 rodent cases per capita,
            with 11/20 neighborhoods falling between .004 and .01 rodents per
            capita. The graph reveals that Back bay, Downton, and South End have
            the highest per capita rodent cases, all above 0.012. Notably,
            Allston, Brighton, Fenway/Kenmore, and South Boston all have per
            capita values below .003. The takeaway from this graph is that many
            neighborhoods have a similar rodent occurrences per capita value,
            but there are some notably low and high rodent values that may
            indicate potential public health and sanitation disparities among
            Boston neighborhoods.

            style="border: none"
          ></iframe>
          <p>
            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph shows the per capita
            occurrences of rodent cases for the highest income neighborhoods in
            Boston and the lowest income neighborhoods in Boston. The income
            groups are determined by the 3 highest and 3 lowest median income
            neighborhoods in Boston. The high income group had a rodent
            occurrence per capita value of .0096, more than .003 higher than the
            low income groups value of .0063. One potential takeaway from this
            graph is that high income neighborhoods tend to be situated in rat
            prone geographical locations. It may also reveal a social pattern of
            higher income individuals, and a higher likelihood to report rodent
            occurrences using Boston‚Äôs 311 system.

      <p>
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This series of graphs explores rat sightings
        in different neighborhoods based on their racial makeup. The graphs
        exploring the neighborhoods with the highest and lowest Black, Asian,
        and Hispanic populations all follow the same pattern: the neighborhoods
        with more of those populations have more rat sightings, and the
        neighborhoods with less of those populations have less rat sightings.
        The graph that explores the rat sightings in the highest and lowest
        White neighborhoods show the opposite: the top three percent White
        neighborhoods have lower rat sightings than the bottom three percent
        White neighborhoods. This concludes that the higher the percentage of
        White people in the neighborhood, the lower the count of rat sightings.

          style="border: none"
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This graph compares the distribution of
          case time completion for high and low income neighborhoods. The income
          groups are determined by the 3 highest and 3 lowest median income
          neighborhoods in Boston. We can see that the minimum, center, and IQR
          placement for both groups are very similar with medians around ~23
          hours. The main difference between these graphs are the outliers in
          the low income group. There are 3 rodent occurrence instances that all
          have completion times above 1000 hours in Roxbury. This potentially
          indicates a systemic disparity between public health and sanitation
          practices for low income neighborhoods. This graph suggests, however,
          that there is no real difference between case completion distribution
          for low and high income neighborhoods.
