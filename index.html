            This project is studying the presence of rodents in Boston
            neighborhoods and analyzing what communities experience the most
            issues with them. This topic is important because there are often
            significant differences in cleanliness of neighborhoods and quality
            of living conditions in major cities, including Boston. We examine
            whether these differences in clean living conditions vary amongst
            Boston neighborhoods by race and income in order to address a larger
            problem of inequality in the United States. Specifically, focusing
            on the presence of rodents in Boston allows us to draw connections
            between these important issues and uncover interesting information
            on who experiences the most problems with rodents in the city, and
            what other factors may be lying beneath those findings.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        We used two datasets from the City of Boston’s open data portal: the
        <a
          href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/311-service-requests"
          target="_blank"
          >311 Service Requests dataset</a
        >
        and the
        <a
          href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/neighborhood-demographics/resource/d8c23c6a-b868-4ba4-8a3b-b9615a21be07"
          target="_blank"
          >Neighborhood Demographics dataset</a
        >. The 311 dataset contains over 200,000 records, but it has been
        cleaned to capture the 5,015 entries related to rodent activity. The
        Neighborhood Demographics dataset provides us with socioeconomic data
        like household income, racial composition, and population size. Merging
        these two datasets allowed for us to analyze rodent activity about
        socioeconomic factors in Boston, making it suitable for our analysis. It
        also includes geospatial data to analyze the rodent activity. By merging
        these datasets on the neighborhood field, we examined whether
        lower-income and racially marginalized communities experience
        disproportionately high rodent activity and slower municipal response
        times. More specifically, we used the features relating to percentage of
        a racial demographic in each neighborhood, income levels, and open and
        close date for case information.
